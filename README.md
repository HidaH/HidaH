I'm a marketing analyst currently working for a large arts centre in London. I have a passion for exploring how Python and SQL can be used to improve marketing strategies. I'm currently learning the fundamentals of data science, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. I have recently completed the HyperionDev Data Science bootcamp and I'm excited to apply these skills to real-world business challenges.

## 🔭 Currently working on:
- Building my skills in Python and SQL through online courses and personal projects
- Exploring marketing data sets to identify trends and insights
- Developing a predictive model for customer behavior using machine learning to identify Membership propensity to arts organisations

## 🌱 Learning goals:
- Mastering Python and SQL for data analysis and manipulation
- Improving my statistical analysis skills for more accurate insights
